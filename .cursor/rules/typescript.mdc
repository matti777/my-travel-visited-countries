# Typescript frontend

Always stick to pure Typescript over frameworks. Also avoid external dependencies if possible.

## Coding standards

1. **Error handling**: Always log all errors to console.
2. **Line length:** Try to avoid code lines longer than 100 characters
3. **Naming identifiers:** Use best practices for Typescript when naming identifiers

## Minification

The built JS bundle must be minified to reduce its size.

## HTML Sanitazing

When generating TypeScript code to convert HTML strings to elements, always include a step for sanitization using DOMPurify.
